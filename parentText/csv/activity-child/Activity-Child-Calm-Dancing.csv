•	This activity helps children learn how to lead. It also builds trust between you and your child.
•	Play a piece of music that is gentle and relaxed to encourage smooth and calming movement.
•	One person goes first and closes their eyes while the other person is the guardian angel or protector.
•	The guardian angel must protect the person with their eyes closed from harm while gently dancing together.
•	When the music ends, the dancer can open their eyes before switching roles.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,c8cc230d-4ae0-4006-ad80-2da3fb9afaf2,,execute_actions,;
