•	Here’s how your children can draw a picture of themselves!
•	Find a big piece of paper or cardboard. It needs to be the same length or slightly longer than the height of your child
•	Ask your child to lie down on the paper. Carefully draw the outline of your child.
•	Now let your child fill in the outline: face, hair, clothes, shoes, or anything they want!
•	Ask your child to draw things that they like and do not like outside of the outline
•	Have a conversation with your child about these things. You may learn something about your child!
•	You can put their outline up in their room or anywhere in the house – it will make your children feel appreciated!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,80bb18c8-0615-45ff-a8f4-66486ff58bc8,,execute_actions,;
