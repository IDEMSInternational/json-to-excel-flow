•	Look around you and name something that you can see. For example, a tree or a cup.
•	Say to your child “I see a tree, let’s be it!”
•	Countdown from 5 and make the shape of a tree with your bodies. Be as big and silly as possible.
•	Now let your child have a turn. What can they see?
•	If you can, go outside and be in nature. If you can’t, play it inside. 
•	When you’ve done it a few times, add moves and sounds!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,e502c546-da5f-4f37-b808-2745d146e141,,execute_actions,;
