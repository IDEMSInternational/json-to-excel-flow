•	Play or sing your favourite music and dance around the room.
•	Dance in different ways or with different parts of your body.
•	For example, “Dance like a monkey”, “Dance like a chicken” or “Dance with just our knees and hips”.
•	Think up different instructions. Be seriously playful! 
•	When the music stops, everyone does a funny freeze. 
•	Give your child a chance to be the one to stop the music! ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,15f69239-e365-4bab-96d8-db362016519d,,execute_actions,;
