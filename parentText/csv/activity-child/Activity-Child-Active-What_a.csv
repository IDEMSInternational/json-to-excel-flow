•	This game is best when more than 2 people play
•	One person pretends to be doing something – for example, combing hair or making dinner  
•	Another person asks, “What are you doing?”
•	The first person needs to say something that has nothing to do with combing hair, for example, “Tying my shoes.”  
•	The second person then starts pretending to tie their shoes until a new person asks, “What are you doing?” 
•	The answer must always be something different than what you are actually doing!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,cdb75de1-082a-489f-b529-895a38dc7937,,execute_actions,;
