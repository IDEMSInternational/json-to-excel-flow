•	Lie on your tummies and pretend your index fingers are a wiggly worm. 
•	With your other hand make a worm house by making a circle with your fingers and thumb and place it on the floor. 
•	Call out an instruction for your finger to touch, like “Worms on noses” or “Worms on ears”
•	When you call out “Worms go home”, your wiggly worm has to find a worm house as quickly as possible. 
•	The last worm to find a home calls out the instructions next. 
•	Keep playing until you feel rejuvenated from lying down. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4da59b3b-5ea0-4343-ae75-931771fff35f,,execute_actions,;
