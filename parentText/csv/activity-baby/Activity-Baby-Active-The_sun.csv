•	Lie your baby on their back after washing them or changing their diaper.
•	Tell them the sun is coming! Wiggle your fingers like sun rays above their head and make your face a big smiling sun.
•	Tell them the wind is coming! Blow softly over their body.
•	Tell them the rain is coming! Use your fingers to gently pat over their whole body like light raindrops.
•	Tell them the clouds are coming! Wrap the towel or cloth around them like a blanket and cuddle them. 
•	Play with different weathers. Which one does your baby like best?
•	Add sound effects or make it into a little song. Use the tune of another song you know! ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ca58b40b-c642-4603-8c2b-67e58d3ae801,,execute_actions,;
