•	When your baby or toddler cries, sing a soft song to calm you both down.
•	Sing a soothing song you know or make up your own with a simple melody and some soothing words.
•	Repeat it over and over in a rhythmical way. For example, “My little one, oh little one”.
•	Sing the same song regularly so your child gets used to it!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,938faa47-82e4-48f2-9efa-391766ea3b2a,,execute_actions,;
