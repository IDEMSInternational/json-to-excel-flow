•	Sit on a chair and put your toddler on your lap facing you. Hold them firmly under the arms.
•	Gently bounce your legs and say in a soft voice “Baby horse, baby horse, baby horse, baby horse”
•	Bounce your legs a bit more and say a bit louder “Little horse, little horse, little horse, little horse”
•	Bounce your legs more and say louder “Big horse, big horse, big horse, big horse”
•	When you call out “Down in a ditch!” open your knees and let your child drop down between them. Make sure you hold them so they don’t fall far! ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,610ee186-1e81-440f-8825-be1bd1dd3cd4,,execute_actions,;
