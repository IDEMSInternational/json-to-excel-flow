•	This game can be played in pairs or even as a group.
•	Stand facing each other or in a circle.  
•	One person leads first while everyone else must copy, trying to move exactly at the same time as the leader.
•	Make sure the leader moves slowly enough for everyone to follow! Explore moving different body parts and in different levels.
•	After a while, switch who is leading. Give everyone a chance to lead.
•	Try it with no leaders!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,06bede64-d364-466f-b891-975dedfb7ddb,,execute_actions,;
