•	Ask your teen what kind of meal they would like to eat.
•	Prepare it together! The first time, you may need to guide them. 
•	Once your teen knows how to prepare the meal, let them take the lead and follow their instructions.
•	 Let each child and teen in the house have a turn at being the head chef.
•	You can even help them make a budget for ingredients!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5eaba5e3-4da4-4542-8dbd-c19ee5a7e692,,execute_actions,240;20
