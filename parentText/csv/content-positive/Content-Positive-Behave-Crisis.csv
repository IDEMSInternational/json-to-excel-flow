• Take a deep breath before you respond. 
• Listen to what your child is saying. Notice how they are feeling.
• Notice how you feel. Ask yourself, ""What does my child need right now?"" 
• Reassure your child that you are there for them. 
• You can deal with the consequences later but right now your child needs you.
• Discuss possible solutions or next steps to take action. 
• Remind your child again that you love them and thank them for sharing with you. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ff921a5d-f975-440b-900b-d5bc09c094b8,,execute_actions,380;900
