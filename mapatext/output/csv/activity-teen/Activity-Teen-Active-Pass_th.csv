1,send_message,start,,,,,,"Pass the Snap  
•	This game is best with at least 3 people.
•	Start in a circle and pass one snap around the circle (or clap if you cannot snap).
•	You snap once to throw the snap.
•	You can bounce the snap, throw it in the air, and catch it a few times before passing it. 
•	The direction (up, down, straight, curved, rolling the ground) and force (hard, soft, medium) that you throw the snap should affect how the person catches it.  
•	Look at the person you are throwing the snap to.  
•	The person who will catch it has to snap once to catch it.
•	When everyone gets good at this, you can start moving around the room, still passing around the snap.  
•	Can you throw under the leg?  Behind the back?  Through your head?  Intercept a pass? Have fun with the snap!  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,69fed6f0-4ede-4a19-b0cf-a58711bb5ce7,,execute_actions,;
