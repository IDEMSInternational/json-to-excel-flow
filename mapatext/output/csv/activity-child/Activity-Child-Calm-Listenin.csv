•	Sit down and close your eyes
•	How many sounds can you hear? Listen to the sounds inside and outside the room. Count them on your fingers
•	After ten seconds, how many fingers do you have up? What sounds did you hear?
•	Try again for another ten seconds. 
•	Can you hear any new sounds? Can you hear any sounds inside your own body?
•	Notice how you feel and ask your child how they are feeling.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1f24c5c6-15a3-44b5-b4db-d5031cfa5387,,execute_actions,;
