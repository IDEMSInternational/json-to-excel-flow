•	Children love to draw! It helps build creativity.
•	Get some pens or crayons and a piece of paper or cardboard.
•	Let your children freely draw whatever they want.
•	While your child is drawing, use words to describe what they are doing: “I see you are drawing a person” or “I see you are making lines with the red crayon.”
•	You can also have fun drawing next to them.
•	Put their drawings up on the wall, refrigerator, or outside to decorate the house – it will make your children feel appreciated!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,403486f0-9115-4dc4-bde7-44401c511850,,execute_actions,;
