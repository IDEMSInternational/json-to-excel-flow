•	Play music or someone sings a song, and everyone dances.
•	When the music stops, everyone must freeze.
•	Last person still dancing becomes the judge for the next round.
•	A variation to Freeze Dance is Animal Dance: It’s the same as Freeze Dance but when the music stops, one member of the family calls out the name of an animal, and everyone has to become that animal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,365585b0-a367-4a36-95ca-893ff22f2c66,,execute_actions,;
