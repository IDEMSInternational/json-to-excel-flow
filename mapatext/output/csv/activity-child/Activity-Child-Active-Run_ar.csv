•	Everyone runs around the room or garden.  Make sure the space is large enough and safe.
•	At any time, someone can stop somewhere and say, “When you get over here, you do this!”  
•	What you do can be anything: push-ups, singing a song, crying, jumping… 
•	The more you play, the more there are things to do in more and more places.  
•	Each person can decide where to go and when.  
•	It’s fun to interact with other people who are doing the same thing as you!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1511186e-6b84-40d8-9cee-897b6c4fff30,,execute_actions,;
