•	Put on your favourite music or sing your favourite song and dance around the room with your toddler. If you have a baby hold them while you dance. 
•	Dance in different ways or with different parts of your body.
•	For example, “Dance like a monkey”, “Dance like a chicken” or “Let’s dance with our knees and hips.”
•	Think up different instructions. Be seriously playful! 
•	When the music stops, everyone does a funny freeze.
•	Notice what rhythms or movements they like!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9e9b3975-7067-498c-a8c5-9986c770c73d,,execute_actions,;
